This project addresses the need for businesses to understand customer feedback on a deeper level, allowing for more responsive and targeted improvements in product offerings and customer service. <br>\n","<br>\n","\n","**Data**<br>\n","The dataset was sourced from the Kaggle platform, specifically the [Consumer Review of Clothing Product](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/consumer-review-of-clothing-product) dataset. This dataset includes customer reviews from Amazon. It has all sorts of feedback from buyers about different products. Along with the customers' actual reviews, the dataset also has ratings, and types of products. <br>\n","\n","**Plan**<br>\n","My strategy for developing an effective model is exploration and evaluation of various machine learning and deep learning approaches. The initial step will involve an extensive study of different algorithms to grasp their underlying mechanics. I am considering experimenting with a variety of models, including the Random Forest, the probabilistic Naive Bayes, and the classic Logistic Regression, to assess their performance. Later, I plan to develop a deep learning model by implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This type of model extracts patterns and features from data for more complex analysis. I am also interested in exploring embedding models which could enhance the model's understanding of subtle differences. My goal is to not only compare models but also to understand their strengths and limitations in terms of handling data, scalability, and computational efficiency. <br>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Data Exploration\n","Histogram of Review Lengths<br>\n","Product Rating<br>\n","Most frequent words<br>\n","Dulplicate?<br>\n","Missing values?<br>\n","<br>\n","Do I have to split data to train and test?\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["df.shape: (49338, 9)\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th>Review</th>\n","      <th>Cons_rating</th>\n","      <th>Cloth_class</th>\n","      <th>Materials</th>\n","      <th>Construction</th>\n","      <th>Color</th>\n","      <th>Finishing</th>\n","      <th>Durability</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>Absolutely wonderful - silky and sexy and comf...</td>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>Intimates</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happene...</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>Dresses</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Some major design flaws</td>\n","      <td>I had such high hopes for this dress and reall...</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>Dresses</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>My favorite buy!</td>\n","      <td>I love, love, love this jumpsuit. it's fun, fl...</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>Pants</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Flattering shirt</td>\n","      <td>This shirt is very flattering to all due to th...</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>Blouses</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                     Title                                             Review  \\\n","0                      NaN  Absolutely wonderful - silky and sexy and comf...   \n","1                      NaN  Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happene...   \n","2  Some major design flaws  I had such high hopes for this dress and reall...   \n","3         My favorite buy!
