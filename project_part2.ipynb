Introduction\n","My project goal is to develop a baseline model using a Naive Bayes classifier, designed to summarize customer reviews. This is intended to help potential buyers quickly navigate through reviews when assessing a product. The system will focus on condensing the essential content of each review and its associated rating into a concise, single-sentence comment. These comments will be categorized as positive, neutral, or negative, aligning with the review's original rating. This approach will simplify the review evaluation process, making it more efficient.\n","**Data** <br>\n","The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, specifically the [Consumer Review of Clothing Product](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/consumer-review-of-clothing-product)\n"," dataset. This dataset includes customer reviews from Amazon. It has all sorts of feedback from buyers about different products. Along with the customers' actual reviews, ratings, product type, material, construction, color, finish, and durability.<br>\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Prep"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":32,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Shape: (49338, 9)\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th>Review</th>\n","      <th>Cons_rating</th>\n","      <th>Cloth_class</th>\n","      <th>Materials</th>\n","      <th>Construction</th>\n","      <th>Color</th>\n","      <th>Finishing</th>\n","      <th>Durability</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>Absolutely wonderful - silky and sexy and comf...</td>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>Intimates</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happene...</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>Dresses</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Some major design flaws</td>\n","      <td>I had such high hopes for this dress and reall...</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>Dresses</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>My favorite buy!</td>\n","      <td>I love, love, love this jumpsuit. it's fun, fl...</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>Pants</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Flattering shirt</td>\n","      <td>This shirt is very flattering to all due to th...</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>Blouses</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                     Title                                             Review  \\\n","0                      NaN  Absolutely wonderful - silky and sexy and comf...   \n","1                      NaN  Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happene...   \n","2  Some major design flaws  I had such high hopes for this dress and reall...   \n","3         My favorite buy!
