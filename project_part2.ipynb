Introduction\n","My project goal is to develop a baseline model using a Naive Bayes classifier, designed to summarize customer reviews. This is intended to help potential buyers quickly navigate through reviews when assessing a product. The system will focus on condensing the essential content of each review and its associated rating into a concise, single-sentence comment. These comments will be categorized as positive, neutral, or negative, aligning with the review's original rating. This approach will simplify the review evaluation process, making it more efficient.<br>\n","<br>\n","**Data** <br>\n","The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, specifically the [Consumer Review of Clothing Product](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/consumer-review-of-clothing-product)\n"," dataset. This dataset includes customer reviews from Amazon. It has all sorts of feedback from buyers about different products.
