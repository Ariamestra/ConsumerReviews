# Consumer Review Summarization

## Project Overview
My goal for this project is to create a model that summarizes reviews which will enable customers to quickly skim through reviews when evaluating a product. This system will condense the content of a review and its associated rating into a single-line comment, categorized as positive, neutral, or negative based on the rating given.

## Part One
In the initial step of this customer review summarization project, the focus is on the analysis of customer feedback. The primary goal is to dissect, understand, and represent the data visually. Many python libraries are used to inspect the text data with the goal of extracting insights that can potentially enhance customer service.

## Installation
Before proceeding with the analysis, please ensure the following Python libraries are installed or imported:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `collections`: Specifically, `Counter` from this library is used for tallying hashable objects.
- `nltk`: This is the Natural Language Toolkit, essential for processing textual data. After the initial installation of `nltk`, you may need to download additional resources, such as tokenizers and the stopwords corpus, to fully utilize its capabilities for text analysis.
- `matplotlib`: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- `seaborn`: A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
