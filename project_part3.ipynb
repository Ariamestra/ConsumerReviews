This will help users in quickly skim through feedback on products by transforming detailed reviews into short comments. These comments will be categorized as positive, neutral, or negative, corresponding to the sentiment of the rating provided. To achieve this, the system will use the capabilities of the pre-trained [T5 model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5), a text-to-text transformer thats good at tasks like summarization.<br>\n","\n","**Data** <br>\n","The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, specifically the [Consumer Review of Clothing Product](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/consumer-review-of-clothing-product)\n"," dataset.
